# Java cert prep class (Module 16)

<style>
@media print {
  pre {
    border: 1px solid gray;

.break {
  page-break-after: always;

### TODO

- What do need to finish on the project?
  - Error handling needs to display errors that will help debug the backend.
    - Front end displays errors that are specific to the front end. Like the response format is wrong.
    - Backend logs any time it sends out an error response.
    - Anything that would be useful when debugging the creating of new endpoints.
