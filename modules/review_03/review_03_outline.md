# Java cert prep class (Review 3)

### Class outline

We'll start the class by covering basic exam information. The slides have most
of the information found on Oracle's website, like official test name/id,
number of questions, allotted time, minimum passing grade, etc. It also
includes information about the way questions as formatted and what can and
should be assumed. It ends with the technical topics that are covered.

After this is covered we can go through random/selected question from the
_OCA/OCP Java SE 8 Programmer Practice Tests_ book or from
[sample_808_questions.pdf](./sample_808_questions.pdf).

The homework will to, first, register with Wiley in order to access the test
prep tools that they provide, then to (1) take an assessment test, (2) review
the glossary they provide (all terms, which is 100+), and (3) start using the
Flashcards enough to get acquainted with how they work.
