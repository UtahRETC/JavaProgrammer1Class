**Guess the number:** the program generates a random number between -250 - 250.
It should then ask the user to guess a number and it will then tell the user if
the guess was high, or low, or correct.  If it is correct, then the program
tells you that you guessed right and it quits. Otherwise, it should have you
guess another nuber.

**Hangman:** create a program that starts with a list of words. The program
should randomly pick one of those words and make the user guess it. You should
tell the user what the lenght of the word is and then on a loop ask them to
guess a letter. If the letter is in the word that was chosen, it should tell
the user the position of every instance of that letter in the word. If the
letter is not present in the word, it should tell the user and make them guess
another letter. Keep track of the number of attempts that the user take,
because after 20 guesses have been made and the game is not complete, the game
should end.
