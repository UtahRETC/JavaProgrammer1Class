### TODO

- What do need to finish the Server project?
  - Error handling needs to display errors that will help debug the backend.
    - Front end displays errors that are specific to the front end. Like the response format is wrong.
    - Backend logs any time it sends out an error response.
    - Anything that would be useful when debugging the creating of new endpoints.
