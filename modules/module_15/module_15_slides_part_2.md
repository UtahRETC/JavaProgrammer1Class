# Review of Previous Week

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This week we're building a Web Server

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Servers and long running processes.

So far we've been working with processes that start and stop once they complete their task. But what about processes that have no known completion? For example, like an HTTP Server. The server doesn't know when a user is going to visit a webpage, so instead it just starts and waits for a request. And as long as nothing goes wrong, it will keep running and listen for more requests.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# New Terminology

==**Request**==: a request, specifically an HTTP request is an incoming message to a webserver from a client, like a browser, or your mobile phone. The server is in change of taking this request and doing something with it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# New Terminology

==**Response**== after the server receives a request, it will do some work and then send a message back to the original client. This is the response.

# Lambdas 101

# What is a request handler?

A request handler is the code that is designated to run when a specific request is made to your server.
