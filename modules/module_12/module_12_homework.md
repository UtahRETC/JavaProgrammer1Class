#### 1. Magic 8 Ball

**TODO: this was copied from Review 2 so replace it!**

Write a program that simulates a Magic 8 Ball. A Magic 8 Ball is a toy that
gives you a random answer when shaken. And the answers are totally random. The
original Magic 8 Ball as 20 possible answers, which you can find here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball#Possible_answers. Your program
should be able to responde with any of the twenty possible answers.

Still not sure what a Magic 8 Ball is? Here's a great video explanation
https://youtu.be/WSaS17CSS4c and a website with similar behaviour
http://www.ask8ball.net/

Below is sample output of what you might see when running your program. Your
output style and text should be the same as what we have provided below:

```text
MAGIC 8-BALL SAYS: Yes definitely
```

```text
MAGIC 8-BALL SAYS: My sources say no
```

```text
MAGIC 8-BALL SAYS: Ask again later
```
