# Java cert prep class (Review 2)

<style>
@media print {
  pre {
    border: 1px solid gray;
    page-break-inside: avoid;
  }
}

.break {
  page-break-after: always;
}
</style>

## TODO:

- Compile list of homework
  Come up with good description for all assignments that we can put in writing
  and examplain during class.

- Pick an assignment (probably Hangman) and figure out how we are going to use
  it as an example to teach and review what we would like to cover during
  class.

- Slides for class. Marcos will start putting together the slides. But we need
  to decide who is going to talk about what.

- Stretch: think about how can we start incorporating javax.swing into future
  classes.


## Review topics:

- What code goes where?
  Where can I put statements?
  Where can I put variable declarations?
  Where can I put method declarations?

- Coding style
  Identation and why it helps

- What is the purpose of the main method?
  Why doesn't every class have a main method?


## During class:

- Use Hangman as an example.

- Project code on to the whiteboard and highlight (using markers) where code
  starts and where it ends. We could use this to review the "What code goes
  where?" and "Coding style" sections.

- Be the computer exercises.
  Nested loops.
  Nested methods where the child does some tricky stuff.


## Homework assignments:

- ???
